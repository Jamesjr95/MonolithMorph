# Project Name

MonolithMorph

## Overview

In this project, I have developed a monolithic Node.js application that hosts a simple message board with threads and messages between users. The goal of this project is to deploy the monolithic application to a Docker container and then decouple it into microservices without any downtime. This will enable easier scalability, maintainability, and the ability to introduce new features, languages, frameworks, and technologies independently.
